# GhostTouch Attack ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-USSLab-blue)

Capacitive touchscreens have become the primary human-machine interface for personal devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
We present GhostTouch Attack, the first active contactless attack against capacitive touchscreens. GhostTouch Attack uses electromagnetic interference (EMI) to inject fake touch points into a touchscreen without the need to physically touch it.
By tuning the parameters of the electromagnetic signal and adjusting the antenna, we can inject two types of basic touch events, taps and swipes, into targeted locations of the touchscreen and control them to manipulate the underlying device.
